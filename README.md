# Work sample - Application developer

## Assignment

- Build an awesome movieapp that shows popular and high rated movies.
- Code it for the platform (Android, iOS, web) you applied for or the one you prefer.

## Requirements

- Use an open https://developers.themoviedb.org/open source API
- Discover most popular and highly rated movies
- Display the movies with creative look and feel of an app to meet design guidelines for your platform (Material etc)
- Launch a detail screen whenever a particular movie is selected

###### User experience

The feature of the app is simple but we expect you to deliver a solution with a high user experience. Imagine this application is to be used by real user with real needs. Maybe your application wonâ€™t be as feature-full as many other applications on the market, but at least make it interesting, fun and intuitive to use. Of course you are allowed to extend your applications functionality. We appreciate solutions that exceed our expectations.

###### Code

We expect that the code is of high quality and under source control. Expect the solution to be continuously worked on by other developers and should therefore be easy to understand, adjust and extend. True beauty starts on the inside!

## Delivery

Fork the repository, code in your fork and make a pull request when done. Also send us an e-mail to let us know when you are done!
